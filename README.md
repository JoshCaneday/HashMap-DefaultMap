As you can see, the folder that holds all the files in this repository is named pa6submit. This was actually a PA for one of my CSE courses at UCSD.
This assignment was given in order to give an in depth understanding of the HashMap data structure as well as defaultMaps.
This assignment is very simmilar to another one of my projects that can be seen on my profile, that being the BST-DefaultMap repository.
We essentially remade this project but instead of using the HashMap to store the data, we used a BST.
If you would like to reproduce this, simply clone the repository and alter the MyHashMapTest java file to your desire to test out the BST.
An additional part of this assignment was to show how this method of storing data can be applied to file systems.
If you want to test out the File System that I made, alter the FileSystemTest java file.
